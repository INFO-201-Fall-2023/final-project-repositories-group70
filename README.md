## Story

Imagine an engineer named Alex who has been working at a technology company for three years. Before the outbreak, he spent his days working in a high-rise building in downtown Seattle, interacting and collaborating with his colleagues, and feeling very fulfilled. But when the pandemic hit, Alex and his colleagues were forced to turn to remote work. While the online communication tools made work more convenient, he began to feel overwhelmed and alone.

ALex's situation is not an exception. More and more employees at tech companies are facing similar challenges. They are starting to feel psychologically stressed and uncomfortable due to long periods of isolation and lack of human interaction. This is particularly acute for employees who already suffer from anxiety or depression. As economic conditions declined, Alex and his colleagues also faced increased job stress and the threat of layoffs.

Increasing mental health issues in tech companies‚Äô employers is not simply a problem in individual level or within the tech field, it actually reveals more about the current situation of our society.

On the one hand, with the combined influence of inflation, higher interest rates, overhearing and pandemic, employers in big companies are suffering from severe lay off.¬† On the other hand, to boost companies‚Äô financial performance, quicker interaction speed and the increasing use in AI have imposed more pressure on employers in tech companies. As a result, it seems that tech workers experience more mental health issues than ever.¬†

These issues not only affected the mental health of employees, but also had a negative impact on the business and culture of the company. Several studies have shown that mental health issues can lead to employee absenteeism, inefficiency, and turnover, which can affect a company's productivity and reputation. And in a high-pressure work environment like a technology company, these problems are even more severe.

Therefore, it is important for technology companies to recognize the importance of employee mental health issues and take steps to help employees relieve stress and anxiety.
Therefore, we need to conduct an in-depth study of this issue and find out the reasons behind this unsolved mystery. Only then can we provide better support and assistance for the mental health of employees in technology companies, and only then can companies maintain the loyalty and happiness of their employees and thus keep their business stable and sustainable.


Interestingly, even knowing these arising difficulties and problems, tech-related jobs are still the most popular career choices considered by most college students.¬†


Thus, by investigating factors leading to increasing mental health problems among tech workers, and comparing data within the tech industry and data in a broader range, we can gain a deeper understanding of potential stressors and mental health issues in tech companies. As a result, college students can better arrange their academic plan and prepare for their future careers instead of simply prioritizing tech-related jobs without holistic preparation. For people who are seeking tech-related jobs or current tech workers, they can be more aware of their mental health conditions and start to develop more systematic coping strategies for adapting the increasing stress in the tech industry nowadays.¬†
